**CONTEXT**:

Homework for Montreal Polytechnique's class *INF8111: Data Mining* part of the graduate degree *Engineering and Data Analytics (AI)*

**DESCRIPTION**:
- Sentiment Analysis of Tweets mentionning airlines.
- Little to no usage of built-in library's methods. Really focused on understanding the mecanism behind BoW, TF-IDF, N-grams, etc.
- Results are aggregated according to the mentionned airlines: *Virgin America*, *United Airlines*, *Southwest Airlines*, *JetBlue*, *USAirways*, *American Airlines*.
- Focus is on learning to pre-process text data and represent text-data into numerical format. Not the performance of the ML classifier.
- Exploring impact on classifier's performance of different pre-processing steps for the pipeline: unigram, bigram, trigram, stemming, lemming, removing URLs, BoW vs TF-IDF.
- Exploring caracteristics of the corpus, including word popularity for different airlines and sentiments.
- Explanations and comments written in French.

**LANGUAGES / TECH**:
